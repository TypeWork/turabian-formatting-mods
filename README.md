# turabian-formatting-mods

The LaTeX packages in **turabian-formatting-mods** each modify the formatting in the [turabian-formatting](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/turabian-formatting) package. They may be used individually or together, depending upon the intended changes needed.

## emptymargins
Formats a document so that the margins are entirely empty (containing neither a header or footer). Header and footers are, instead, placed in the content area of each page.

## single-spaced-lists
This package formats itemized and enumerated lists as signle-spaced, regardless of the spacing of the rest of the document.

## turabian-thesis-secnumbers
Intended for use with `turabian-thesis`, `section` and `subsection` headings are numbered. The Table of Contents is formatted accordingly.
